In almost every web application we need auditing fields like Created By,Modified By, Created At & Modified At.
This will help us get information about record like who created this record & when ,also when was record last time updated 
& by whom.

So lets implement this by beautiful feature **behaviors** provided by YII.
Let say we have table namely **customer** with below auditing fields.

| Column Name   |     Type      |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| created_by    |   varchar     |
| modified_by   |   varchar     |
| created_at    |   timestamp   |
| modified_at   |   timestamp   |

Add below code in your models/customer.php

```
use yii\behaviors\TimestampBehavior;
use yii\db\Expression;
use yii\behaviors\AttributeBehavior ;

 public function behaviors()
    {
        return [
            'timestamp' => [
                'class' => TimestampBehavior::className(),
                'attributes' => [
                    \yii\db\ActiveRecord::EVENT_BEFORE_INSERT => ['created_at', 'modified_at'],
                    \yii\db\ActiveRecord::EVENT_BEFORE_UPDATE => 'modified_at',
                ],
                'value' => new Expression('NOW()'),
            ],

            [
            'class' => AttributeBehavior::className(),
            'attributes' => [
                \yii\db\ActiveRecord::EVENT_BEFORE_INSERT => ['created_by','modified_by'],
                \yii\db\ActiveRecord::EVENT_BEFORE_UPDATE => 'modified_by',
            ],
            'value' => function ($event) {
                return Yii::$app->user->identity->username;
            },
        ],
        ];
    }

```

This will fields will get created & updated automatically.
