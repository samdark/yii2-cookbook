# Continuous Integration

This section will explain what we call as continous integration to increase the efficiency of development of a Yii2 application.

## Prerequisite

In this article, we will use several free platforms available for our continuous integration process. You can choose other alternative platforms to your choice, the concept is pretty similar.

- Github for our source code repository. Alternatively you can use Bitbucket.
- Travis for our build server. You can set up Jenkins on your own or use other platform.
- Heroku for our production platform. Other alternatives are AWS Elastic Beanstalk.
