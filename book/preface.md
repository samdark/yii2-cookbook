Preface
=======

Yii is a high-performance PHP framework designed from the ground up to develop modern web applications and APIs that can run in a multi-device environment.

Yii comes with rich set of features including MVC, ActiveRecord, I18N/L10N, caching, authentication and role-based access control, code generation, testing, and REST based API framework. Together with a comprehensive set of documentation and a enthusiastic user community Yii can reduce your development time significantly compared with other frameworks.
